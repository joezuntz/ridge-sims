    """Estimate density rigdges for a user-provided dataset of coordinates.
    
    This function uses an augmented version of the subspace-constrained mean
    shift algorithm to return density ridges for a set of user-provided
    coordinates. Apart from the haversine distance to compute a more accurate
    version of a common optimal kernel bandwidth calculation in criminology,
    the code also features thresholding to avoid ridges in sparsely populated
    areas. While only the coordinate set is a required input, the user can
    override the number of nearest neighbors used to calculate the bandwidth
    and the bandwidth itself, as well as the convergence threshold used to
    assess when to terminate and the percentage indicating which top-level of
    filament points in high-density regions should be returned. If the latter
    is not chose, all filament points are returned in the output instead.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    coordinates : array-like
        The set of latitudes and longitudes as a two-column array of floats.
        
    bandwidth : float
        The bandwidth used for weighting points in the ridge update.
        If the 
    
    convergence : float
        The convergence threshold for the inter-iteration update difference.

    max_unconverged_fraction : float, defaults to 0.001
        The fraction of points that are allowed to remain unconverged
        before the iterations stop. This is used to avoid running for too long
        when the points are very close to converging, but not quite there,
        or are oscillating around target points.

    max_iterations : int, defaults to 5000
        The maximum number of iterations to run before stopping.
    
    mesh_size : int, defaults to None
        The number of mesh points to be used to generate ridges.

    n_neighbors : int, defaults to 5000
        The number of nearest neighbour points used to update ridge points.
        You should check convergence of this parameter for your use case.
            
    distance_metric: string, defaults to 'haversine'
        The distance function to be used, can be 'haversine' or 'euclidean'.
    
    mesh_threshold: float, defaults to 4.0
        Throw away initial mesh point more than this many bandwidths from any coordinate

    checkpoint_dir: str, defaults to None
        If provided, the directory where the intermediate results will be saved.
        This allows for resuming the computation from a previous state.

    min_checkpoint_gap: int, defaults to 30
        The minimum time in seconds between checkpoints. This prevents
        excessive checkpointing during the iterations, which can things down,
        especially towards the end.

    resume: bool, defaults to False
        If True, the function will attempt to resume from a previous run
        in the checkpoint_dir

    seed: int, defaults to None
        If provided, sets the random seed for reproducibility.
        Required if using checkpointing as otherwise the resumed
        run will not match the original run.

    tree_file: str, defaults to None
        If provided, the file where the BallTree will be saved or loaded from.
        If the file exists, it will be loaded; otherwise, a new tree will be created.
        This is mainly useful when testing.

    comm: mpi4py.MPI.Comm, defaults to None
        If provided, the MPI communicator to use for parallel processing.
        If None, the function will run in single-process mode.

    Returns:
    --------
    ridges : array
        The coordinates for the estimated density ridges of the data.

    initial_density : array
        The initial density of the mesh points before iterations.
    
    final_density : array
        The final density of the ridge points after iterations.
        
    Attributes:
